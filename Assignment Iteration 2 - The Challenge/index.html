<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game's point values are directly connected to the amount the player moves the cursor. If the player decides to stay safe and not move the cursor, they won't make any points, and will probably die.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game simply makes use of the position of the cursor. It randomly generates all of the "bullets" and places them at the edges of the game. with a specified velocity to move into the player's view with. The bullets are then destroyed when they reach the bounds of the world, only to be replaced by new bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>
		What did you learn from this prototype?
		</li>
		<li>
		Having bullets move in straight lines, while still hard, simply looks boring.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
		</li>
		<li>
			Realizing that my clean up code was deleting some of the bullets as they were being generated, resulting in only bullets moving from top->bottom and left->right.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bullet: self-made</li>
<li>Player: self-made</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
	<ul>
		<li>
			The game is a bullet hell. I can't think of any specific games that it may resemble.
			Code from the original example was used. The aforementioned code is commented as not being mine.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're in a bullet hell. Survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
	<ul>
		<li>
			n/a
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mouse Input
		</li>
		<li>
			Randomly generated Bullets
		</li>
		<li>
			top-down survival
		</li>
		<li>
			point-and-(not)click?
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Unending Bullet Hell Survival
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
	<ul>
		<li>
			To simply have fun trying to survive in the most risky ways possible to build up as many points as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
	<ul>
		<li>
			The player is trying to survive as long as possible in this bullet hell. The point algorithm rewards going all over the place, thus encouraging theoretically risky play.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Going all out and seeing how wildly you can move the cursor to make points in as little time as possible. (To rack up as much points as possible before dying.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Making small, precise, movements to stay alive as long as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	<ul>
		<li>
			The game is abstract. No story. Just experimenting with gameplay/gamefeel. Enjoy it.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
	<ul>
		<li>
			People who enjoy challenging themselves via high score.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Entirely dependant upon your own skill level.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ul>
