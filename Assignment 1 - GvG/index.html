<h2>Don't touch the lava!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game's point values are directly connected to the amount the player moves the cursor. If the player decides to stay safe and not move the cursor, they won't make any points.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game simply makes use of the position of the cursor. It randomly generates all of the "lava blocks" and places them around the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>
		What did you learn from this prototype?
		</li>
		<li>
		That I did not know any where near as much of the Phaser API as I needed to before I started.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
		</li>
		<li>
			The hardest part was that I started implementing a procedural terrain generation algorithm called the "Diamond-Square algorithm". Until I realized that I couldn't implement it in time, due to not understanding enough of Phaser.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>None were used.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
	<ul>
		<li>
			This game could be considered close to Asteroids. Except for the fact that you aren't destroying anything, you're just maneuvering around them for as long as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're a Geologist, and lava hurts geologists.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Geologist
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mouse Input
		</li>
		<li>
			Randomly generated lava pits
		</li>
		<li>
			top-down survival?
		</li>
		<li>
			point-and-(not)click?
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Unending Survival
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
	<ul>
		<li>
			To simply have fun trying to survive in the most risky ways possible to build up as many points as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
	<ul>
		<li>
			The gameplay is simple. The Geologist is scared and is running around, but is at least sane enough to at least partially listen to your input (the cursor's movement). Your job is to keep the Geologist from touching any lava. The more drastic the movements you make, the more points you get. You also have an additional point modifier that increases with every 10 second time period. The original idea was to add in the Diamond Square terrain generation algorithm and then have it loop in such a way that the player would have to "walk" through a lava field.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Going all out and seeing how wildly you can move the cursor to make points in as little time as possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			Making small motions around the "geologist" so as to keep him relatively in place, but also be moving the mouse enough to make small amounts of points that would add up over time.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	<ul>
		<li>
			A geologist, near lava, no idea how he got there, he probably doesn't either. He is just lost and confused and wants you to not kill him by leading him into the lava. He trusts you, don't betray his trust.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Anyone who would want to play a mindless game for the pure aspect of getting a higher score each time
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
	<ul>
		<li>
			Entirely dependant upon your own skill level.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ul>
